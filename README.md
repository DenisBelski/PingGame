# PingGame
This project implements a simple ping game with walls. 
You can move the racket using the right and left buttons on the keyboard.
The program also shows your result in seconds in real time and records the result in a separate window.
Don't let the ball cross the bottom line. Try to last as long as possible. 
So that you are not bored, the ball becomes faster with each successful beating.
